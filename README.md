# odin-book-list

The Odin project library list.

I updated this from the initial version to use a class for the book object, as per the followup assignment.

TODO:
1. Lots of CSS styling, especially for the add book form -- this is the mvp version for now.
2. I think it might make sense to make the myLibrary array a module as well?
3. Storing myLibrary in localStorage (which I assume is coming).
4. Filtering by whether the book has been read or not, or by some other criteria.
5. Adding more functionality: maybe put in when you finished a book, if you read it, or looking up cover art, etc. from an API?
