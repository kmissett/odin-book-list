# odin-book-list

The Odin project library list.

TODO:
1. Lots of CSS styling -- this is the mvp version for now.
2. Storing myLibrary in localStorage (which I assume is coming).
3. Filtering by whether the book has been read or not, or by some other criteria
4. Adding more functionality: maybe put in when you finished a book, if you read it, or looking up cover art, etc. from an API?
